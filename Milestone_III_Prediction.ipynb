It is accomplished with anonymous lambda functions that contain string manipulation techniques such as strip and replace.  In cases where null values can exist, if statements are used to determine them, and the null value, 'No Data' is replaced with a 1.

It is important to note that qcut function ranks movies based solely on their own data set.  So, a movie is ranked as a high earner if it made a large amount of money for its series, even if the series in general trends toward low financial returns.  This is a more useful metric than comparing them to all films in general, as it keeps high or low earning series from having all their movies classified as such.  In the original dataframe, each group is assigned a numberic title 0, 1, or 2, for low, average, and high respectively.  These are changed in the display dataframe into text strings for easier viewing.  The code for this is interesting as it uses a map function in the 'Rating Category' and a nested if statement within a lambda function for the 'Revenue Category'. </p>"

We then use the accuracy_score of the sklearn library to test our predicted list against the actual data that we saved and dropped earlier.
